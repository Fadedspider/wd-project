                <h3><b>Historical Genesis</b></h3>
                <p>Central Secretariat Library (CSL) under the Ministry of Culture is one of the largest tangible treasures of knowledge next to National Library, Kolkata for Indian and foreign document resources. CSL‚Äôs resources are an amalgamation of many old institutions including the resources of Imperial Secretariat Library, Calcutta that came into existence in 1891 during the period of Lord Curzon and validated by the Imperial Library Act of 1901. The Act stated that 'It was intended that it should be a library of reference, a working place for students and repository of material for the future historians of India, in which, so far as possible every work written about India at any time can be seen and read'. F.W. Forester, Curator of the Imperial Records Office, assembled about one thousand volumes lying about in the Writer‚Äôs Building, Calcutta received under the press and Registration of Books Act, 1867. This collection along with variety of collections belonging to other secretariat libraries located in that building was named the Imperial Library which was inaugurated on 11th May 1891. The collection of the Home Department was the most important collection which merged with the Imperial Library. Books formerly belonging to the libraries of East India College, Fort William College, and the East India Company Board in London formed part of the collection. When under the Imperial Library Act, a new Imperial Library was established, the entire collection of the erstwhile Imperial Records Office was not transferred to new library rather a portion of the collection was with the Imperial Secretariat Library, to distinguish it from the Imperial Library, and which continued to function in the Writers‚Äô Building.</p>
                <p>The Imperial Secretariat Library was transferred to Delhi in 1912 with the shifting of the Capital to Delhi and was housed in the Old Secretariat Building, Civil Lines Delhi. In 1913, part of the collection was moved to Shimla Secretariat. With the inauguration of the new Secretariat in New Delhi on 10th February 1931, the Imperial Secretariat Library was moved into North Block, and the Secretariat Library which was functioning in Shimla was also amalgamated with the Imperial Secretariat Library. On 1st April 1948, the library was named as Central Secretariat Library. In 1969 the Library was shifted to the newly constructed Shastri Bhawan, housing the Ministry of Education, the 'G' wing of the building was allotted to CSL.</p>

                <h3><b>ADMINISTRATIVE SETUP</b></h3>
                <p>During 1958-59, CSL was under the control of the Central Education Library of the post independence period, and was earlier known as Bureau of Education Library under the Bureau of Education, Department of Education, Health and Lands during the imperial government. It was shifted to North Block in 1933. Few more mergers took place. UNESCO Library was merged with CSL in 1949, Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs library was merged in 1950, and rare and valuable collection of about 1600 volumes of distinguished personalities and reference books was donated by Sir G. Friendly Shiras to the CSL.</p>
                <p>In 1972, to commemorate the quadri-centenary of Goswami Tulsi Das, an eminent saint poet of Indian literature, a Regional Language Library was set-up. Another branch library at R.K. Puram was established to provide readers service to the government servant working in R.K. Puram. Till 1971 the CSL was under the control of the Department of Education, Ministry of Education and in 1972 it was shifted to Department of Culture which was part of the Ministry of Education, then Ministry of Human Resource Development and now under the Ministry of Culture.</p>
